Instant Funding registration and withdrawals are currently supported from your desktop and the OnDeck mobile website. They are not currently supported in the OnDeck mobile app. Occasionally, the transfer may take up to 30 minutes to complete due to potential Visa & bank processing lags.

We\u2019ve outlined best practices for your marketing disclosures below.\n\nRecommended Terms:\n1. Always refer to yield as \u201cyield.\u201d\n2.

Stripe has approved the variations of the phrase \u201cFDIC Insurance eligible\u201d noted below on marketing materials, as long as certain conditions are met.  Specifically, the statement of FDIC insurance eligibility must always be paired with two disclosures:\n\n1. Stripe Treasury Accounts are eligible for FDIC pass-through deposit insurance if they meet certain requirements. The accounts are eligible only to the extent pass-through insurance is permitted by the rules and regulations of the FDIC, and if the requirements for pass-through insurance are satisfied.  The FDIC insurance applies up to 250,000 USD per depositor, per financial institution, for deposits held in the same type of account (business versus personal, and so on).\n2. You must also disclose that neither Stripe nor you are an FDIC insured institution and that the FDIC\u2019s deposit insurance coverage only protects against the failure of an FDIC insured depository institution.\n\nThe following terms that incorporate the term \u201celigible\u201d are approved:\n1. \u201cEligible for FDIC insurance\u201d\n2. \u201cFDIC insurance-eligible accounts\u201d\n3. \u201cEligible for FDIC pass-through insurance\u201d\n4. \u201cEligible for FDIC insurance up to the standard maximum deposit insurance per depositor in the same capacity\"\n5. \u201cEligible for FDIC insurance up to $250K\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t use the following terms:\n1. \u201cFDIC insured\u201d\n2. \u201cFDIC insured accounts\u201d\n3. \u201cFDIC pass-through insurance guaranteed\u201d\n",

            "instruction": "You are a compliance check bot. Below is Stripe's marketing policy for treasury based services.I will specify the headings and content of a website and you will reply with whether the headings and content of given website are compliant with stripe's policy or not.\n\nMany states have statutory prohibitions on references to \u201cbanking,\" \u201cbanks,\" and \u201cbank accounts\u201d when the entities making these references are not state- or federally-chartered banks or credit unions. Imprecise terminology of Stripe Treasury accounts might draw scrutiny from regulators.\nFor your platform to efficiently leverage Stripe Treasury, you need to brand and communicate the nature of the product while being mindful of regulations. Refer to the following list of recommended terms to use in your messaging when building out your implementation of the product.\nAvoid the terms in this list for any marketing programs you create because only financial institutions licensed as banks can use them.\n1.

Phrases that suggest your users receive banking products or services directly from bank partners, for example:Create a [Bank Partner] bank accountA better way to bank with [Bank Partner]Mobile banking with [Bank Partner]\n\nYield compliance marketing guidance\n\nAs a platform, you can provide your customers with yield, calculated as a percentage of their Treasury balance. We understand that this can be a great value proposition as part of your product. When you market and disclose yield to your potential and existing customers, don\u2019t conflate yield with interest. We\u2019ve outlined best practices for your marketing disclosures below.\n\nRecommended Terms:\n1. Always refer to yield as \u201cyield.\u201d\n2. Always disclose prominently in your marketing materials that the yield percentage is subject to change and the conditions under which it might change.\n3. Notify your existing customers whenever the yield percentage has changed. Prominently display the most recent yield percentage in their dashboard.\n\nTerms to avoid:\n1. Never refer to yield as \u201cinterest.\u201d\n2. Don\u2019t reference the Fed Funds Rate as a benchmark for setting your yield percentage.\n3. Don\u2019t imply that the yield is pass-through interest from a bank partner.\n\nHow to talk about FDIC insurance eligibility\n\nStripe Treasury balances are stored value accounts that are held \u201cfor the benefit of\u201d our Stripe Treasury users with our bank partners, Evolve Bank & Trust and Goldman Sachs Bank USA. We disclose to you which of our partners hold your funds. For FDIC insurance to apply to a user\u2019s balance in a \u201cfor the benefit of\u201d account, we must satisfy the rules for FDIC pass-through deposit insurance, unlike a bank account directly with an FDIC insured bank.\nWe understand that FDIC insurance eligibility can be a valuable feature to your customers. Stripe has approved the variations of the phrase \u201cFDIC Insurance eligible\u201d noted below on marketing materials, as long as certain conditions are met.  Specifically, the statement of FDIC insurance eligibility must always be paired with two disclosures:\n\n1. Stripe Treasury Accounts are eligible for FDIC pass-through deposit insurance if they meet certain requirements. The accounts are eligible only to the extent pass-through insurance is permitted by the rules and regulations of the FDIC, and if the requirements for pass-through insurance are satisfied.  The FDIC insurance applies up to 250,000 USD per depositor, per financial institution, for deposits held in the same type of account (business versus personal, and so on).\n2. You must also disclose that neither Stripe nor you are an FDIC insured institution and that the FDIC\u2019s deposit insurance coverage only protects against the failure of an FDIC insured depository institution.\n\nThe following terms that incorporate the term \u201celigible\u201d are approved:\n1. \u201cEligible for FDIC insurance\u201d\n2. \u201cFDIC insurance-eligible accounts\u201d\n3. \u201cEligible for FDIC pass-through insurance\u201d\n4. \u201cEligible for FDIC insurance up to the standard maximum deposit insurance per depositor in the same capacity\"\n5. \u201cEligible for FDIC insurance up to $250K\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t use the following terms:\n1. \u201cFDIC insured\u201d\n2. \u201cFDIC insured accounts\u201d\n3. \u201cFDIC pass-through insurance guaranteed\u201d\n",
